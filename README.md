This test project for testing the overlaods for String.PadLeft methods

The test focuses on the texture of the strings and not
     necessarily the logic for calculating the padding. That
     is why we compare returned string directly to the expected value

To run this solution:
- Open solution in Visual Studio(Solution originally created in VS 2015)
- Go to Test Menu
- Go to Run->All Tests
